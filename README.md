# Music-Player-Manager
🎵 Music Playlist Manager (C++ Console App)
📌 Project Overview
The Music Playlist Manager is a C++ console-based application that helps users manage a playlist by adding, removing, sorting, searching, and playing songs. It showcases Object-Oriented Programming and uses multiple core data structures and algorithms for better efficiency and functionality.

🧱 Features
Add or remove songs from the playlist

Display complete playlist

Sort songs by title (Merge Sort) or duration (Bubble Sort)

Search songs using Linear Search and Binary Search

Play songs using a double-ended queue (Deque)

Undo last played song using a Stack

Display recently played songs

🧰 Data Structures Used
Doubly Linked List → For Playlist and Deque (Flexible insert/delete from both ends)

Singly Linked List (Stack) → For Recent Songs (LIFO undo functionality)

Array → Temporarily used for Binary Search (indexed access)

📚 Sorting & Searching Algorithms
Merge Sort → Sorts songs by title

Bubble Sort → Sorts songs by duration

Linear Search → Searches song titles sequentially

Binary Search → Efficient title search (after sorting)

🚀 How to Run
Copy the code into a .cpp file (e.g., main.cpp)

Compile the code using any C++ compiler.
Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the playlist.
